				<p>I am a Graphic and Web Designer currently enrolled in a dual degree program at Western University and Fanshawe College. I hope to graduate by 2018 and apply my skills and traits to an industry setting.</p>

				<p>Proficient in the extensive library of Adobe products, my main passion within my program was design. Web content, logos, marketing materials, mockups, and branding are all things I am familiar with.</p>

				<p>I also have an understanding of coding languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, and PHP. Whether its in bootstrap or foundation mobile first responsive design is always a must.</p>
